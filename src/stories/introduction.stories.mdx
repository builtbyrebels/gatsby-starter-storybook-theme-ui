# Introduction

> This is a work in progress ðŸš§

This is a demo to show how Storybook can be integrated into a Gatsby project.

Storybook is an invaluable tool for creating and tweaking UI components in isolation, and doesn't require Gatsby to be running.

You can use stories to mock data and review the many different permutations.

## Best practices

While it is possible to use Gatsby's Static Queries within your components, it is generally good practice for your components to not depend on any external data.
